// consistent with most programming languages that don't support outer classes.

// A reasonable prefix for the Objective-C symbols generated from the package.
// It should at a minimum be 3 characters long, all uppercase, and convention
// is to use an abbreviation of the package name. Something short, but
// hopefully unique enough to not conflict with things that may come along in
// the future. 'GPB' is reserved for the protocol buffer implementation itself.
